> Bridging clinical insight and software engineering to build resilient digital infrastructure for African healthcare, commerce, and mobility.

---

## 🚀 Mission  
Design and implement modular, automation‑driven platforms that solve real operational bottlenecks in under‑served markets—prioritizing interoperability, scalability, and contextual relevance.

---

## 🧠 Core Domains  
| Domain | What I Build | Impact Focus |
| ------ | ------------ | ------------ |
| HealthTech | EHR modules, telemedicine, lab & clinic ops | Workflow efficiency & continuity of care |
| SaaS Automation | Multi-tenant back‑office & AI‑assisted tooling | Operational leverage for SMEs & startups |
| Mobility & Gig Economy | Ride-hailing + service aggregation layers | Inclusive economic participation |
| Cross-Border Commerce | Marketplace + logistics/payment abstraction | Regional trade enablement |

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

**Languages:** JavaScript (ESNext), Python, SQL, HTML, CSS  
**Frameworks & Runtimes:** React, Next.js, Node.js, Flask, FastAPI  
**AI & ML Integration:** Hugging Face (transformers for assistive triage / automation prototypes)  
**Databases:** MongoDB, PostgreSQL, MySQL  
**Architecture & Patterns:** REST APIs, modular monorepos, multi-tenant SaaS design, auth & RBAC flows  
**Tooling & Dev Experience:** Git, GitHub, Docker, CI/CD pipelines, Monorepo tooling (e.g. Nx / Turborepo patterns), structured env configs  
**Design & Product:** Figma (UX flows & component systems), domain modeling, lean validation cycles  
**Operational Focus:** Caching strategies, background job queues, observability (logs/metrics), privacy-aware data handling

## 🏗️ Notable Projects (Concept → Prototype)

### Shamula  
A hybrid ride-hailing + gig economy platform tuned for fragmented regional markets.  
Focus: Driver liquidity, service bundling, alternative payment rails, scalable dispatch logic.

### ZimZam Commerce  
Cross-border e-commerce infrastructure linking Zimbabwe ↔ Zambia sellers & buyers.  
Focus: Logistics abstraction layer, settlement & FX friction reduction, trust & escrow flows.

### Zim/Zam Health OS  
Modular operating system for small to mid-sized healthcare practices.  
Modules: Patient registry, consultation records, lab workflow, billing, referral chain, AI-assisted documentation.

### Musber Creative Studio  
Digital branding + software solutions hub; internal incubator for reusable SaaS and health workflow components.

## 📈 Current Goals  
- Advance Shamula MVP architecture (service boundaries & event surfaces)  
- Ship a reusable automation bundle (notifications, scheduling, finance ops primitives)  
- Integrate AI-assisted triage / documentation features into Health OS via Hugging Face models  
- Publish a cohesive portfolio site consolidating product and technical narratives

---

## 🌱 Actively Exploring  
- Event-driven & queue-based patterns (Redis streams / RabbitMQ)  
- AI augmentation of clinical documentation & operator workflows  
- Payment orchestration & multi-currency microtransaction handling  
- Privacy, consent, and data minimization for regional health systems

---

## 🧩 How I Work  
- Domain-first: map entities & lifecycle before UI polish  
- Modular monorepo: shared primitives + isolated deployable services  
- Ship learning artifacts (schemas, diagrams, architecture notes) alongside code  
- Bias toward reliability, clarity, and incremental scalability over premature complexity

---

## 🏅 Selected Highlights  
- Engineered early multi-tenant module strategy for a Health OS prototype (reducing feature coupling).  
- Implemented AI-assisted proof-of-concept (Hugging Face transformers) for clinical note scaffolding.  
- Standardized internal monorepo conventions improving build & test cycle times.  
- Architected cross-border commerce flow abstractions addressing FX & settlement latency.  

---

## 🤝 Collaboration & Interests  
Open to:  
- HealthTech pilots & data workflow refinement  
- Early-stage SaaS architecture / monorepo reviews  
- Cross-border marketplace experimentation  
- AI augmentation of operational or clinical processes  

> Mission-aligned problems welcome—especially where constraints are tough and context matters.

---

## 🔧 Planned Public Artifacts  
- health-os-schema.md (entity + relationship map)  
- shamula-arch-overview.md (mobility + gigs abstraction layer)  
- multi-tenant-saas-patterns.md (tenant isolation & shared services)  
- african-fx-and-checkout.md (commerce friction notes)
